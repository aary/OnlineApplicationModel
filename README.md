OnlineApplicationModel
================================

###How to run the project
To run the project simply compile it with a C++ compiler such as g++ (if on mac, open terminal and type g++ main.cpp) and run the executable. The *.dat files are local applications saved in binary format. 

A very simple makefile is also included in the project. To use it type `make` in terminal and then execute the executable named `application` by typing `./application`. Type `make clean` or `make fresh` (to delete all previous app data) followed by `make` to recompile and rerun.
